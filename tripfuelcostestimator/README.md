i. Trip Fuel Cost Estimator
Trip Fuel Cost Estimator is a simple Flutter application that helps users calculate the estimated fuel cost for a trip. By entering the travel distance (in kilometers), the vehicle’s fuel efficiency (in km per liter), and the current fuel price (in RM per liter), the app quickly computes how much the journey will cost.It provides an easy-to-use interface with clear input fields and an instant result, making it useful for drivers who want to plan their travel expenses more effectively.
ii.Inputs
•	Distance (km) – the total distance of the trip.
•	Fuel Efficiency (km/L) – how many kilometers the vehicle can travel per liter of fuel.
•	Fuel Price (RM/L) – the cost of one liter of fuel
   Process
•	The app takes the user’s input values.
•	It applies the formula:
 
•	The program calculates the total estimated fuel cost based on the entered values.

     Output
•  Displays the estimated total fuel cost in Ringgit Malaysia (RM).
•  Shows a clear result 
iii. Widget list used :
Text – displays static text (titles, labels, and results). 
TextField – allows user input for distance, efficiency, and fuel price. 
ElevatedButton – clickable buttons for “Calculate” and “Reset”.
Row / Column - to arrange widgets horizontally (Row) or vertically (Column)
Container - A box-like widget that can hold other widgets and control their size, color, or padding.
AppBar – displays the title “Fuel Cost Calculator” at the top.
BoxDecoration → used in the Container to add a border and rounded corners.
Navigator.pushReplacement() → used to move from Splash Screen → main app after 3 seconds (not a widget, but part of navigation logic).
Image.asset – displays your app image/logo (assets/car.png).
iv.Basic Validation Approach
 
The validation helps make sure all required inputs are entered correctly before calculating the fuel cost.
